I am a Software Engineer based in France, mainly interested in Data Engineering, Distributed Systems and Data Analysis of very large datasets focusing on operational applications. I graduated from Telecom Bretagne and ENS-Cachan ([MVA](https://www.master-mva.com/)) where I studied theoretical and applied Machine Learning.

Areas of interests
======

I try to combine strong development skills (Managing large code repository and create robust architecture) and algorithms development (Pure python or PyTorch). At the crossroads between ML Engineering / Software Architect with a bit of both. I am working mainly in Python / Java for product development and TypeScript / React for frontend.
